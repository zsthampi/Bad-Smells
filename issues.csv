In either case, the email verification step can be in magic link setup, linked to a button to verify email. If we accept email as username, we'll send to that address; if we accept usernames of any kind, we'll have a field asking for email, and send to that.

user3,"['user3', 'user1', 'user2']","- [x] Create design/prototype for text mining. (Zubin. ETA : Feb 13. Extended to Feb 18)
Following summarizes the design for text mining approach 
1. Get reviews/contents from Piazza
2. For each course, convert them into Vector (Using Doc2Vec data algorithm) 
3. From the Doc2Vec model, get the similar words to a list of words we are interested in. (For example : Professor, Rating, Course, Difficulty etc) 
4. Compare the output from Doc2Vec model to a set of Good Words and Bad Words (These set of good and bad words are available on the internet) 
5. Compute a rating for each course - count(good)/(count(good) + count(bad)) 

- [x] Convert output from Piazza API (Javascript) to JSON format and pass it to Python script which does the Doc2Vec modeling 
- [x] Research more on Doc2Vec modeling, and coding it up on Python 
- [x] Make a list of words we are interested in 
- [x] Get the list of good words and bad words 
- [x] Code up on Python and test
- [x] Find out ways to extract text from attachments (PDF, image etc). Right now, Piazza posts these as hyperlinks - parse the HTML link (or download the PDF), and extract its content 
- [ ] Check how to get Course content evaluated (easy vs hard as opposed to usual good vs bad) (PUSHED TO MARCH MILESTONE)
- [x] Integrate to Ruby website

Jan 14, 10:11 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
That's fine for me
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:11 AM
Matthew Farver  
I'm ready
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:11 AM
you want to try the full blown conference with voice and video ?
in such case, i will need to reboot my laptop to enable those features
give me some mins ☺ sry, i disabled those features from cmos...
Jan 14, 10:12 AM
Matthew Farver  
ok
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:13 AM
i'll reboot and rejoin real quick...
Jan 14, 10:13 AM
You missed a call
Jan 14, 10:17 AM
Missed call from Matthew
Jan 14, 10:17 AM
can you see or hear me ?
Jan 14, 10:19 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
I can see and hear Matt but only can see Tam
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:21 AM
Matthew Farver  
i can see Tam and SzTing but cant hear 
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:21 AM
weif it's too much of a problem, we can do the vid next time and just chat for now... if you're cool with it
Jan 14, 10:22 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
sure
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:23 AM
Matthew Farver  
yea thats fine
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:23 AM
You were in a call with Matthew and SZ TING
Jan 14, 10:23 AM
Matthew Farver  
I guess we need to narrow down and pick a problem to focus on 
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:24 AM
Ithink so too.
The good thing is it appears that in the 2nd paper link i sent, the author gave hints on how to solve most of the problems
Jan 14, 10:28 AM
Matthew Farver  
Yea, I think that will make your lives a little easier
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:28 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
What we have now are: 1. the infection issue 2. with open data so we can reduce patients' cost?
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:29 AM
Christine, would you tell more about that since Matt was not at our other meeting.
Jan 14, 10:30 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
Sure.
There're lots of unnecessary care(could be some avoidable harm for patients) or cost in healthcare systems now.
If the medical information is open, patients can make their own decision about the treatment.
 During our meeting on Thurs. Tam suggested that we can narrow down to suggesting which insurance to choose
Speaking of open data, my friends also told me that barcode will be a good tool for both hospital staffs and patients
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:36 AM
Matthew Farver  
I like it, for the purpose of this project i think finding a solution to improve patient safety (acquired infections) may be a simpler choice 
I am just thinking from our point of view, of how difficult do we want to make our lives with this project
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:37 AM
yeah Matt. We discuss it and found out that the easiest way to work with reducing costs for patients is through helping users choosing the right health insurance. It sounds like an old idea but I think there are ways to help users. I also agree with you that creating apps for patient safety is a simplier choice
Jan 14, 10:37 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
But the most problem we have here will be the source of information or data
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:38 AM
Matthew Farver  
me may run into health information privacy issues  
looking into the insurance side
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:39 AM
the problem with the insurance idea besides a huge data we need to collect, and privacy is how we can come up with 3 days to do that one thing
Jan 14, 10:40 AM
Matthew Farver  
true, i think we have a lot me flexibility working with the spread of infection topic 
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:41 AM
But Christine, can you tell more about what you friend told you ? I would love to hear
Jan 14, 10:42 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
We may also need some knowledge from insurance representatives?
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:42 AM
yeah... 
Jan 14, 10:44 AM
Matthew Farver  
I did an internship for a pharma company last summer and the way health insurance works is extremely complicated
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:44 AM
I think it will be easier if we structure our arguments like this
How can we help everyone in Health Care ?
By improving patient flow and the speed of treatments
How to do that >> by improving Safety
and we can either stop at that, and branch out to 3 branches
or we can drill down to patient safety
and within patient safety, we tackle 3 ways to do it
one of which is preventing hospital acquired infection 
by that, we can easily branch out to 3 branches, one for each of us easily. How do you think? The open data is a great idea but since it's quite complicated, i don't know how we can have 3 ways of doing a complicated task...
Jan 14, 10:49 AM
Matthew Farver  
I think focusing on one specific problem like acquired infection is the way to go
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:50 AM
ok
Christine, I think with acquired infection, information and communication is also the Key
Jan 14, 10:51 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
Agree
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:51 AM
If you are passionate about data and information and integration, you can do research on that and take it as your own way to solve the issue
Jan 14, 10:51 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
Okay, but do you have any other ideas abt what other 2 solutions could be?
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:54 AM
Also, if we come up with a good app to help preventing infections then the app can also be used for home care, and in that sense, it will help patients at home and the ones careing for them reduce costs too
Jan 14, 10:55 AM
Matthew Farver  
Now that we have chose an issue to focus on we can think up ways to solve it, we can meet up before class and share our ideas 
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:56 AM
me, as of now, I will come up with a game for the patient, either help them maintain good habits during the time they are under care.
Jan 14, 10:56 AM
Matthew Farver  
yea i think their are many different ways to improve this problem
its just a matter of picking 3
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:57 AM
good idea Matt. I tried to check out the full book of the 2nd paper but can't find the online book i checked out
The book has several recommendations. Oh, Christine, the book also has at least one chapter discuss about information and data
Jan 14, 10:58 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
The 2nd one right? will read that :)
SZ TING • Jan 14, 10:59 AM
Matthew Farver  
with this topic I dont think we will have issues finding 3 ways to improve it
Matthew • Jan 14, 10:59 AM
yeah. I think we will have plenty.
Jan 14, 11:00 AM
Matthew Farver  
do we want to meet before class on Tuesday? 
Matthew • Jan 14, 11:01 AM
I am fine with that.
should we agree on a general meeting schedule ?
Jan 14, 11:01 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
A general meeting schedule will be good
SZ TING • Jan 14, 11:03 AM
Matthew Farver  
I agree
Lets meet before class on Tuesday and we can discuss the solutions each of us thought up and determine a general meeting schedule 
Matthew • Jan 14, 11:04 AM
sure.
Jan 14, 11:05 AM
Matthew Farver  
is everyone available on Tuesday before class?
Matthew • Jan 14, 11:05 AM
SZ TING TZENG  
Yes for me
SZ TING • Jan 14, 11:05 AM
Matthew Farver  
3pm?

yes. I'm fine with that

Jan 14, 11:07 AM
Matthew Farver  
ok
Matthew • Jan 14, 11:07 AM
I'll check the conversation archive when I get back.

You too!

SZ TING TZENG  
Apart from our topic, one of my friend(pharmacist side) told me that there're 2 problems annoy them most: 1. the systems they used in hospital are unstable and inefficient
 2. patients have too many questions abt the medicine they use, and the only way for patients to get information is from pharmacist. my friend also mentioned that barcode seems an efficient way to deal with this problem
many hospitals in Taiwan are launching the barcode method for both patients and hospital staffs
SZ TING • Jan 14, 11:30 AM
Matthew Farver  
SZ TING TZENG  
so now patients have another way to understand what medicine they are going to use
and it also increase the performance of staffs on identifying medicine 
SZ TING • Jan 14, 11:34 AM
See you at 2323 ☺

- Expiration Date Checker
- Car Finding in Parking Area
- Connecting Patients to Health Professionals/Doctor
  - In rural areas, the people are not able to get better health so to connect them thereby better health services
  - Can be done by making a web page as well as an application. As the rural areas just have low bandwidth so they can send symptoms via SMS services.
  - Possible to make but for checking have to check the SMS client(free is not available).
- News priority based on present Location(GPS)

Pooja
- Notification System with location sensing (Similar application as grocery crowd sourcing but for a generic purpose)
- Card Tracker Application/Software (Initially start with a wolfpack one card)
- Android Reminder/Alarm with GPS Sensor (Reminds you of what to do when you enter a particular area)
- Attendance System

Qiufeng
- Application for Grocery crowdsourcing
- Sublease finder
  - A plateform which helps you find the person who is looking for appartments
  - I know craigslist sort of does the job, but we might need a more professional plateform.
- An application which synchronizes and updates all of your emails from different account (Such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.).
- Workout plan generator
  - Users need to input their basic information(heigh, weight, percentage of body fat)
  - Users need to input their expectations, such as, do they want to lose fat or build muscle
  - Expected time period. Like gain 10 lbs of muscle in 30 days
  - The program can automatically pick the right workout plan from the database
